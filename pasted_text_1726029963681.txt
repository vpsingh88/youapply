"Design and build a platform called 'Youapply.ai' that streamlines job applications by automating the process for job seekers. Key features should include:

User Registration and Profile Setup:

Users can sign up using email, Google, or LinkedIn.
Once signed in, users upload their CV or LinkedIn profile.
Users input specific job preferences, such as salary, location, time frame for finding a full-time role, and openness to part-time or consulting work.
Job Matching and Recommendation System:

A backend engine matches users' CVs with job descriptions and provides three daily job options.
Users receive a daily email or dashboard notification with the top 3 job suggestions based on their preferences and CV.
A recommendation system continuously learns from user interactions to improve job matches over time.
Automated Job Application Process:

When users select a job, the system navigates to the job's career page using browser automation (e.g., Selenium).
The platform submits applications with customized CVs and cover letters tailored to the job description.
OpenAI/ChatGPT integration reviews job descriptions and adjusts the CV and cover letter to optimize for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) and job fit before submitting.
JD to CV Matching and Lead Scoring:

Implement lead scoring to prioritize job matches based on the compatibility of job descriptions with the user's CV.
API Integration with Perplexity:

The platform uses Perplexity's API to search for 10 companies similar to the user's CV profile, scrapes jobs from their careers pages, and suggests new opportunities.
Cron Jobs for Daily Company Searches:

A cron job is scheduled to find 3 new companies daily that match the user's profile. The system sends an email to the user with job openings from these companies.
Users can easily apply to these jobs directly from the platform.
Admin Dashboard & Paid Features:

An admin dashboard allows control over platform settings and user management.
Integrate Stripe for premium features such as unlimited daily applications, enhanced CV updates, and priority support.
ATS Score and CV Optimization:

Add a simple ATS analysis feature where users can upload their CV and receive a score out of 100, showing how well the CV would perform against Applicant Tracking Systems.
Job Application Tracking:

The platform should have a built-in tracking system to monitor which jobs have been applied to, application statuses, and potential follow-up actions.
Mobile and Web Compatibility:

Ensure the platform is responsive for mobile devices as well as desktop users.
